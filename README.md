In class activity 2

In this assignment we were asked to create 3 simple python programs that consisted of;
    a) simple calculator
    b) divisor calculator
    c) random password generator

Psudo-Code
    This was not very prevalent as the programs were quite simple. this was a real code and go
    kind of programming style. 

Once the skeleton of the code was written, I added a basic user interface with prompts in the
command window. This will allow the users to interact with the programs easier.
